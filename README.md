### Introduction

Welcome to the Seoul Bike Sharing Data Analysis project! This initiative aims to address the dynamic challenges associated with urban transportation by leveraging comprehensive data on bike sharing systems in Seoul. As urban populations continue to grow, and concerns about environmental sustainability rise, understanding and optimizing transportation systems become increasingly crucial.

##### Objectives

1. **Usage Patterns:** Analyze temporal and wheather patterns of bike sharing to identify peak hours and wheather influence.

3. **User Behavior:** Understand user behavior and preferences to optimize services and enhance user experience.

4. **Seasonal Variations:** Investigate how bike sharing patterns vary across seasons, weather conditions.

##### Why This Matters

By delving into the Seoul Bike Sharing Data, we aim to contribute to urban planning, improve infrastructure, and promote eco-friendly transportation alternatives. The insights gained from this analysis can guide policymakers, city planners, and bike-sharing service providers in enhancing the overall transportation ecosystem in Seoul.
